<p align="center"><strong>How to use Creeper Catcher</strong></p>
<p>Creeper Catcher by Application Innovation is an app that tells the user who looks at their facebook page.</p>
<p>Step One:</p>
<p>Tap the start button. A web browser will appear. Sign into Facebook with this web browser. Facebook might ask you some security questions.</p>
<p>Step Two:</p>
<p>Once you have navigated to any Facebook page where you are logged in the app will load a list of your top 5 creepers by order of how often they go to your page or interact with you. If someone looks at your page everyday but never chats with you, they will be at the top of the list. Someone who occasionally likes your post, but never visits your page may be in the middle of the list and someone who you have friended but otherwise never interacted with will be at the bottom of the list or not there at all.</p>
<p>Step Three:</p>
<p>Save the resulting list for later viewing or press the back button to start all over again.</p>
<p>Creeper Catcher does not store or save your email or password information. Using this app will not result in you being spammed or having your private information released to anyone.</p>
<p>Check out the Pro version</p>
<p>Creeper Catcher Pro gives you a list of almost everybody who has been to your 
page, instead of just the most recent or most frequent visitors. You can also 
search the large list to see if specific people have visited your page.</p>
