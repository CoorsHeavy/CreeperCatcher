# CreeperCatcher

Creeper Catcher is an android application that shows its user who interacts with their facebook account most and who they interact with. The app operates by having the user log into facebook, reading the html source of their news feed page for the list of users' ids, getting those users names and profile picture and displaying them in a list.

This project has been discontinued because Facebook doesn't like it when you read their website's source code to gather data. If I ever continue working on the app, I will probably rebuild it from scratch because this version could've been better in every way.
